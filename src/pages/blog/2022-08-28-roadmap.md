The following are some potential features that are being considered as enhancements to this starter. Please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/hellotham) us if these features are important to you and you would like them to be implemented sooner. Alternately, if you want to implement any of these features, please let us know and we will be happy to support you!

- full support for authors (with author profiles and avatars)
- photo gallery support using PhotoSwipe

Current issues:

- Img component doesn't work in prod due to @astrojs/image not respecting base in output, hopefully this will be fixed soon. [#4436](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/4436)
- MDX content currently not included in search as it does not support rawContent property.
- Better support for Mermaid (awaiting possible official integration by Astro)
- Should really use load package scripts/CSS from node_modules rather than external CDN, but can't figure an easy way of doing this. Problem is these assets are not statically loaded by dynamic per page based whether they are required or not.
